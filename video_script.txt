Introduction:
 - Brief introduction to the problem
 	We've all experienced the stress of trying to find a park. Sometimes you wish you could predict where the best place to find a park would be. With ParcMe, you can.

 - brief project description
 	We have produced a real-time model of parking demand and supply in the melbourne CBD. Our model predicts the probabiltiy that a space will become available in a certain area, forcast ahead by a given time period. Combined with data from the BCC parking meters, we would be able to predict the probability that a parking space will be available when you arrive at your destination.

The Data:
 The main data set we've used is records of Melbourne parking events for 2014, obtained through the Melbourne CIty Council data portal. This is a very comprehensive data set, including every parking event occuring during the year, with information on arrival time, duration, departure time and location data. In all there are around 16 million records.
 We have used this data set to estimate parking demand at a given 15 minute interval, and forcast ahead the probability that a parking space will be available at a destination.
 Our model is also able to be combined with a secondary data set from the Brisbane City Council, which will allow prediction of parking demand in the Brisbane CBD.

Real-Time Prediction:
Using real-time data of parking space availability, it is possible to serve information about number of available parking spaces in real time. Our hack goes further than this simple use, to not only report on the number of spaces available at this point in time, but to allow forcasting future parking space availability. This would allow someone to enter their expected arrival time, and our model will give the expected number of spaces availbale on arrival in each street segment.

Data investigation:
 - We began by investigating the data avialable, looking for any trends in parking behaviour across an average day. (INSERT DAILY DEMAND GRAPH - TALK TO DEMAND GRAPH).
 - Next we investigated any systematic behaviour for parking spaces of a certain type (for example, 1P limit parking) (INSERT PDF AND CDF for 1P). Points to note:
 		- Large number of parking events in 1P zone have very short duration (dropoffs). This is reflected in a high probability of departure after short durations.
 		- After around 30 minutes, parking departures are fairly constant, and the probability that someone will leave remains steady up till around the parking limit (1 hour)
 		- At 1 hour, there is a small increase in the number of departures(people leaving at the end of the duration)
 		- After 1 hour, probability of departure reduces (a long term parking event is likely to continue. This could be an artifact of a residential permit system).
 - CDF plot - we have used the average CDF to predict the probability that a departure will occur in the next 15 minutes (or any time interval)
 		- CDF is probablility that a departure has occured in the time prior.
Benefits:
Reduced trip times, reduced emissions, reduced traffic in CBD.
More reliabale mode choice selection - people would not drive if probability of getting a park is low.


Further development:
Develop model to use hazard function for prediction of probability of departure using more explanatory varialbes (such as area, street, surounding business type, parking zone type).

Further data required:
Our models are currently based on the comprehensive data provided by the Melbourne City Council. Although we can apply our model to Brisbane parking using presently available data, we are having to translate Melbourne parking space supply and demand into Brisbane.

If other councils, traffic authorities, or organisations such as UQ provided a similar level of live traffic data, our model could be easily customised for their specific parking conditions.
